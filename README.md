# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using ANN

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9). The model is trained on labeled digit images and predicts the digit shown in an input image.

## Key Features
- Preprocessing images for normalization and reshaping.
- ANN model built with Python libraries like TensorFlow/Keras.
- Training and evaluation on the MNIST dataset.
- Visualization of training accuracy and loss.
- Script to predict digits from custom images.


## Dataset
The project uses the MNIST dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of digits. It can be loaded directly using TensorFlow/Keras.
